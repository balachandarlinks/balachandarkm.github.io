title: The Potential of a simple bug in Twitterâ€™s Android Client

---

A week back, I created a new twitter handle ( [@audifyapp](http://twitter.com/audifyapp) ) for [Audify](https://goo.gl/lST1u8). I created it using the Twitterâ€™s official android client and started following people. While doing that, I noticed that Audifyâ€™s profile pic was used instead of the Twitterâ€™s default egg profile pic for users who didnâ€™t setup a profile pic. So basically, I have seen many people with Audifyâ€™s profile pic.

I didnâ€™t take it as a big concern as I know that this is a bug and might be fixed at some point in future. But today morning, a friend of mine mentioned me in his tweet and asked for help to report an user who is using his profile pic without his concern !!!

I just checked his profile and found this long chain of tweets â˜º Thankfully both of them are highly civilised and didnâ€™t get themselves in to any verbal spat.

I cleared the air for them ðŸ˜‡

Interestingly it happened to him for a specific user and showed the egg profile pic for some other users. Even for me, it is inconsistently picking up my profile pic for users without a profile pic !!

Anyways, This incident can be a very good example of how a simple bug in an app can make a big impact on itâ€™s users. So letâ€™s think twice or thrice before prioritising a bug ðŸ˜Ž
